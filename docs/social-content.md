**Title:** I built a Claude Code plugin that unifies 10 AI image generation providers [Open Source]

**Body:**

I got tired of switching between different image generation APIs depending on what I needed. DALL-E for text, FLUX for photorealism, Ideogram for logos... it was a mess.

So I built **Image Gen** - a Claude Code plugin that unifies all 10 providers into one interface.

**What it does:**

- **Intelligent selection** - Claude automatically picks the best provider for your prompt (text-heavy? Ideogram. Photorealistic? BFL FLUX)
- **Automatic fallbacks** - If one provider fails, it tries the next. Your workflow never breaks
- **10 providers** - OpenAI DALL-E 3, BFL FLUX.2, Stability AI, Ideogram, Google Gemini, FAL, Leonardo, Recraft, Replicate, ClipDrop

**Quick install:**

```
/plugin marketplace add shipdeckai/claude-skills
/plugin install image-gen@shipdeckai/claude-skills
```

Then just ask Claude:

> "Generate a professional product photo of a coffee mug"

It picks the right provider automatically.

**Why 10 providers matters:**

| Provider | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| OpenAI DALL-E 3 | General purpose, text rendering |
| BFL FLUX.2 | Photorealism, 4K resolution |
| Ideogram v3 | Typography, logos |
| Recraft v3 | #1 ELO ranked, vectors |
| Leonardo | Artistic, fantasy, characters |

It's MIT licensed and free to use. Would love feedback from the community.

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
10 AI image providers. One command.

I built a Claude Code plugin that unifies OpenAI, FLUX, Stability, Ideogram, and 6 more.

Here's why that matters: 🧵

**Tweet 2:**
The problem: Different providers excel at different things.

- DALL-E → great at text
- FLUX → photorealism king
- Ideogram → typography master
- Leonardo → artistic renders

Switching between them manually? Pain.

**Tweet 3:**
Image Gen solves this.

Tell Claude what you want. It picks the best provider automatically.

"Generate a product photo" → routes to FLUX
"Create a logo with text" → routes to Ideogram

No thinking required.

**Tweet 4:**
But here's the real killer feature:

Automatic fallbacks.

If one provider fails (rate limits, downtime, whatever), it tries the next best option.

Your workflow never breaks.

**Tweet 5:**
The 10 providers:

• OpenAI DALL-E 3
• BFL FLUX.2 (4K!)
• Stability AI SDXL
• Ideogram v3
• Google Gemini Imagen 4
• FAL
• Leonardo
• Recraft v3 (#1 ELO)
• Replicate
• ClipDrop

**Tweet 6:**
Installation takes 30 seconds:

```
/plugin marketplace add shipdeckai/claude-skills
/plugin install image-gen@shipdeckai/claude-skills
```

Then just ask Claude to generate images. Done.

**Tweet 7:**
Built with:

• TypeScript + Zod for full type safety
• Enterprise-grade error handling
• Intelligent caching
• Native Claude Code integration

Not a wrapper. A proper unified interface.

**Tweet 8 (CTA):**
It's open source (MIT license).

If you use Claude Code for anything visual, give it a shot.

Stop juggling 10 different image generation APIs.

Last month I was working on a project that needed AI-generated images. Sometimes I needed photorealistic product shots (FLUX). Sometimes logos with text (Ideogram). Sometimes artistic renders (Leonardo).

Switching between APIs, managing different credentials, handling different response formats... it was inefficient.

So I built something better.

**Image Gen** is a Claude Code plugin that unifies 10 AI image generation providers into one interface:

→ OpenAI DALL-E 3
→ BFL FLUX.2 (up to 4K)
→ Stability AI SDXL
→ Ideogram v3
→ Google Gemini Imagen 4
→ FAL, Leonardo, Recraft, Replicate, ClipDrop

**The key insight:** Different providers excel at different tasks. Instead of you choosing, Claude picks the optimal provider for each prompt automatically.

Need typography? Routes to Ideogram.
Need photorealism? Routes to FLUX.
Need artistic style? Routes to Leonardo.

Plus automatic fallbacks - if one provider fails, it tries the next. Your workflow never breaks.

**Installation (30 seconds):**

```
/plugin marketplace add shipdeckai/claude-skills
/plugin install image-gen@shipdeckai/claude-skills
```

It's open source (MIT license) and free to use.

If you're using Claude Code for anything that involves image generation, this might save you significant time.
